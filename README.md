# Bring Your Buddy Data Pack for Minecraft 1.13 / 1.14 / 1.15 / 1.16

This data pack allows players to request others to bring them to their location at a cost depending on the dimensions they are in.

## Features:
- Bring your friends teleporting them interdimensionally!
- Request system that requires two players to agree to go forward with the process
- Automatic request expiration in case no one answers it (default 30 seconds)
- Teleportation cost levels, depending the dimension they are located
- For now, only one teleport request at a time is supported

Make sure to set your **sendCommandFeedback** gamerule to **false** to avoid trigger spam

## Usage:

Any player can request to be teleported using the command **/trigger tp**
A message will be send to the other players. The cost will be included in the message. If anybody agrees, a message will be send to the requestor to confirm.
Once confirmed, the player will be teleported

Enjoy!
